# STM32-Microcontroller Programming
The Basic STM32 Microcontroller Programming course provides knowledge about the STM32 microcontroller line - an ARM Cortex M core microcontroller commonly used today in real projects and devices. This course helps students firmly grasp the fundamental knowledge and be able to practice, build models, and practical applications of microcontrollers and embedded systems through GPIO, EXTI, UART, ADC peripherals. , TIMER, PWM. STM32Cube IDE software and HAL library package provided by STMicroelectronics are used to help students access this 32-bit microcontroller line quickly and effectively. Debug tools, datasheet reading skills, reference manuals, and schematic analysis are also equipped for students to deeply understand the hardware structure, operating principles as well as build their own firmware code for the STM32 microcontroller.

## Software
STM32Cube IDE, KeilC IDE, Visual Studio Code

## Hardware
Recommended: Board from Discovery, Nucleo. Board from third party partner like BluePill, Mini can also be used but make sure it's authentic so that the code can be loaded from Software STM32CubeIDE
